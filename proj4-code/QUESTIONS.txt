Project Instructions
================

    The following questions assume you have completed the code and will ask you
    about what you observed. The questions are essay style and will be manually
    graded. You should write at most one paragraph (roughly 3 to 5 sentences)
    for each question that asks for an explanation. For the question that asks
    you to calculate cache misses, you must show all of your work.


1. CACHES AND CACHE MISSES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
According to the "lscpu" command run on a Keller Hall 1-262 machine, the L1
cache of a Keller 1-262 machine is 128 kilobytes (where 1 kilobyte = 1024
bytes). Assume the cache has a 64-byte block size.

Suppose we are running a C program on one of the Keller 1-262 machines that
features an int array with 262,144 elements. Assume the array is aligned to the
L1 cache's block size (i.e., the array's starting address is a multiple of 64).
Our program performs a linear search over the array for a value that is not
stored in the array.

How many cache misses occur during this search? You should ignore the loop
variable (e.g., "int i"). Make sure to show your work.


2. WALL TIME AND CPU TIME
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In the 'matrix_main.c', we measure both the CPU and wall time required for the
functions to run. What is the difference between these two types of time
measurement? When might we be interested in the wall time? CPU time? Which
makes more sense to use for what we care about in this project?


3. LINEAR SEARCH 3-TIMES
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This question refers to the work you did in Lab 8. Refer back to this lab as
needed to answer this question.

We asked you to improve upon a provided version of the function "list_find".
Why was the provided version inefficient? How did your improved version compare
to performing the same search using an array instead of a linked list? Why do
you think this is?
